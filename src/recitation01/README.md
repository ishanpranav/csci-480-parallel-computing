# Recitation 1: Introduction to C programming
In this recitation you will develop a C program to determine if a given number is odd or even. 
## Requirements
You must have a function “count_odd_even” that returns/prints the number of odd and even numbers within a given range. This function must be included as a header file in your main c program.

The output of your program should print no. of odd and even numbers.

The program should set the seed of the random number in a general way , such as using the time. Only set the seed one time... do not constantly reset the seed.
