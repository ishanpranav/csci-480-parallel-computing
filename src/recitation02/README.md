# Recitation 2: Arrays and Pointers
## Mode
Devise a C program which generates 1000 random numbers between the
range of 1 and 10 and prints out the number which is repeated the most.
## Letter frequency
Given a string, devise a C program which determines the max repeated
character in the string. Ensure that string is taken as a pointer input.
