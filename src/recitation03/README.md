# Recitation 3: Linked List
1. As discussed in the class, create a linked list (non malloc version). Devise
a function to swap 2 middle nodes of the linked list. Ensure that the linked
list has at least 4 nodes and is of even length.

    Ex 1: 1->2->3->4->Null

    After Swapping middle nodes: 1->3->2->4->Null

    Ex 2: 11->22->33->44->55->66->Null

    After Swapping middle nodes: 11->22->44->33->55->66->Null

2. Implement a function to reverse the nodes in a linked list
